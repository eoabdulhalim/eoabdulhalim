- My learning journey has begun with how to solve a problem I trained to solve problems using C++ and how to save space and time then I browsed everything related to the computer from basics software studies like data structures, algorithms, databases, OOP to hardware studies like how a computer works inside, I loved to take from each field a good background even if I will not use it in my real work, after my 3rd year while studying statistics in my college beside computer science, I was passionate about data and how AI uses it in predictions and learning.
